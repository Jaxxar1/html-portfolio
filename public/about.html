<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I'm from a small town in Central Florida ^if you could call it a town^, named Linden. We have 3 churches, no red lights, and a couple stop signs. There's no census but I'm sure less than 300 people live here. We're about 40 miles west of Orlando and 40 miles northeast of Tampa. I've always loved to learn and my recent *fixation* is coding. I started to learn HTML about a year ago and lost the motivation about a month in, it's recently returned with a vengeance, though. I started back up with Python, but it seems like HTML is a bit more enjoyable and speaks to me more so far.
